# This workflow tests that the dev container configuration within
# opensafely/research-template is correct with respect to the tests within
# `tests/dev_container.sh`. Notice that the dev container configuration lives in a
# different repository. This is because opensafely/research-template is a template
# repository; its contents are copied to multiple other repositories. Rather than test
# the dev container configuration in each of these multiple other repositories, we test
# it here, and assume that the copies don't deviate from the template repository. Doing
# so reduces the cost of updating the tests.
