This is an OpenSAFELY Codespace

All 'opensafely' commands (e.g 'opensafely run', 'opensafely exec') are available
in this terminal.

The latest version of ehrQL has been installed, and the Python and R libraries installed
here are the same as those available in the corresponding OpenSAFELY actions.

Additional help is available in the #opensafely-users Slack channel and at
https://docs.opensafely.org/getting-started/how-to/use-github-codespaces-in-your-project/
